Through Squarespace, our team was able to create an interactive website that allowed users to import a syllabus. By customizing our own PDF upload button, we were able to accept a syllabus through Dropbox on the website. Using Zapier, we were then able to direct the syllabus to Google Drive. 

Once the pdf file makes it to the Google Drive folder, using python, we take the pdf and convert it to a CSV. This file is then processed through pandas where it removes all excess data, leaving a cleaned CSV file in a separate folder in Google Drive. The CSV file in this folder is then sent to Dropbox with Zapier, which will then be emailed back to you.

Once you download the CSV, it can then be imported to your personal calendar via Settings once inside Google Calendar.

Happy scheduling!
